Here we collect and publish all our proprietary fonts.  
Add a new package for each font.  
If you are looking for a open font you may find it in [typefaces project](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces) and you can download it as a npm package.  
To use a font in your (parcel, webpack) project just install and `import` the font package e.g. `import '@iin/typeface-iran-sans'`
